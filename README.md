# StadiStats
This app visualizes the data from a Google Takeout export for Google Stadia.

Have you ever wondered, how many hours you already spent on Google Stadia in total, or what is your average session time per game.
Google let's you simply export that data with the Google Takout service. Since this data is only available in JSON and splitted in to many files, this tool here visualizes the data.

Just upload the ZIP Takeout file and it will start to process and to visualize then the data.
